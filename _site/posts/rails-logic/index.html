  <h1>On logic in a Rails app</h1>
  <span class="post-date">24 Dec 2012</span>
  <p>Recently, Grant Ammons wrote <a href="http://gammons.github.com/architecture/2012/12/22/where-the-logic-hides/">a nice article</a> about where logic should lie in a Rails app. I would like to complement his opinion, and probably add some real life arguments to it.</p>

<p>Grant extracted logic from the controller, and put it in a separate object, which I also do most of the time. However, a user named DHH (which probably is DHH) said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So all you&#39;ve done here is extract the work of the controller action into a separate object. This adds needless indirection, makes the code base harder to follow, and is completely unnecessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I strongly disagree, and I have good reasons for it.</p>

<p>You know what makes the code base hard to follow? Fat controllers with logic in them. I worked on a Rails app with Controllers of 800 lines of code, <strong>it. is. a. freaking. nightmare.</strong></p>

<h2>My approach</h2>

<p>I look at Rails as web presentation layer, it makes my app work in the browser. This has some consequences to my codebase:</p>

<ul>
<li>data-only models (no logic should be in models)</li>
<li>logicless controllers (no logic should be there either)</li>
<li>anything else is in single-responsibility objects in <code>app/domain/</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You might think that this is a refactor pattern, and you are right. And you might say that this unnecessary to do from the start, and you may also be right. But the cost of creating a file and moving behaviour there is exactly 0, but the benefits are there from day 1.</p>

<h2>Why I do it</h2>

<h3>Fast tests</h3>

<p>The least I am coupled to Rails, the fastest my tests are. Currently, on a medium Rails project my tests run 2-3 seconds, where 90% of the time is wasted to boot rails and test models.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t test my controllers, because they have no logic in them. My methods in controllers don&#39;t have more than 4-5 lines of code.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">RatingsController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create</span>
    <span class="n">success</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">RatesBusiness</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_rating</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:business_id</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                       <span class="n">params</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:score</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">,</span>
                                       <span class="n">current_user</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">render</span> <span class="ss">json</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">success</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">success</span><span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><code>RatesBusiness</code> has some foursquare-related logic besides just creating a entry in the database. Using this approach, I have a <em>very</em> fast TDD flow, because most of the time I don&#39;t need Rails to test my logic. (any dependency to models is stubbed, as any other external dependency).</p>

<p>Your controller only connects your logic to the web interface.</p>

<h3>Code and forget</h3>

<p>If you have a well tested functionality that works, you don&#39;t need see it in front of you when you code in your application. This is where single-responsibility objects kick in, I TDD them one time, I know about their existence and what their interface is, I will not ever see their code again.</p>

<h3>Framework agnostic</h3>

<p>When your app logic is not coupled with Rails, you do not depend on it, its version, or interface. Isolating some functionality to a service is a matter of moving some files around.</p>

<h3>Reduced stress and debug times</h3>

<p>Most of my classes fit in one screen, and have descriptive names as <code>CategorizesCampagins</code> or <code>FiltersBusinesses</code>, which makes debugging them very, very easy and pleasant. I don&#39;t need to scroll the hell out of my screen to understand how an isolated piece of functionality works.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Rails is just a framework to make your app work on the web, don&#39;t mix your logic with rails-y stuff. Your app domain should be defined anywhere besides Rails views, controllers, and models.</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>First, and most influential person for me is <a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt">Gary Bernhardt</a> and his screencast series <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">destroyallsoftware</a>. If you want to learn isolated testing - watch this guy, he is amazing. (He even test-drives bash scripts :D)</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.codeclimate.com/blog/2012/11/28/your-objects-the-unix-way/">Your objects the UNIX way</a>.</p>

<p>Also, my approach was influenced by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGN4RFkhH2M">Hexagonal Rails</a> concept.</p>
